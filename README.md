# Secure-Chat
A secure chat app using node.js
The user needs to be logged in to be able to participate in the chat provided the username is not already taken.
The app is a public chat with private chat functionality. When the user types @username with some message, the message can only be seen by the user whose name is typed. 
Also, the app checks for the valid-user when sending private messages. The application shows the list of active users in the chat.
